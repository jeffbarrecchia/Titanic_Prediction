# Titanic_Prediction
In this project, the idea was to construct a predictive model through classification to decide who will or will not die aboard the Titanic. Used in this project was CatBoostClassifier. I also made several informative displays regarding different variable and how they relate to survival aboard the Titanic, including a heatmap covering the correlation of all variables.
